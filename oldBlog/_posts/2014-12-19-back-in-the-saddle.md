Here I am a week removed from Demo Day at the Iron Yard. Now that the dust has settled and I've had some time to, you know, get some sleep, I'd like to look back on the time I spent at The Iron Yard as a student and analyze all of the moments of learning and struggle to really get the most out of the experience... but there's no time for that shit! I've got to build stuff!

I was not the happiest in the world with what my final product was at the end of the cohort, so I've decided my first project on my own will be creating a playable version of Cards Against Singularity. For those who were not able to make it to Demo Day last Friday, Cards Against Singularity was the end result of the failed attempt at making a multi-player, multi-device, real-time version of the game Cards Against Humanity in a week and a half with the years of experience I have. As you can imagine that didn't quite go as planned so my partner and I pivoted to a new concept that will take the ideas behind a game of cards against humanity and will abstract it out into a massively single player game. Basically it's a rapid-fire Cards Against Humanity on both ends. As a player you will be answering absurd and often crass questions with the 10 white answer cards provided. These combos will then fill a pool that will be judged on in Czar mode by you and other terrible people that play this game. If they find you funny, you get an awesome point. If they don't, they point and laugh at how sad and pathetic you most likely are. (I don't think you're sad and pathetic though)

That's the rundown of where I was right at pivot, but given that from pivot to presentation day was only 6 days, we were only able to produce a rough prototype to demo last Friday. Since then I've started working on making the idea come to life and an incredible thing happened. When I wasn't stressing out about how much time I had left to complete my project, I could actually think clearly. I realized I know a lot more Angular and Firebase than I could give myself credit for in the thick of the project. With this new found confidence, I've made great strides and I have a majority of the basic functionality completed. Things are looking good and my target for releasing the app by the beginning of next year seemed possible. That is, until I decided to make things that much more complicated.

Enter: Ionic. I really want the app to look/feel/act like an app and not just a website that kind of acts like an app. As I'm trying to create a card game, Ionic's ```card``` class was really intriguing to me. I installed what I needed to install, watched the 30min crash course video, and got to work! I plan to spend the next few days playing with the framework and trying to slowly mix in the work I've already done for Cards Against Singularity into the Ionic Framework while making the stylistic choices I feel would be best for the app.

As I begin to discover the facets of the framework and run into problems, I'll use this forum to describe what I'm doing, where I am, and how I get over the obsticles.
