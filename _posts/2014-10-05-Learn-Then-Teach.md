### Learn then Teach

It's now been 2 full weeks at The Iron Yard. It has been quite an intense two
weeks to say the least. Lots of initial understanding of a new concept, followed by the slow
degradation of that knowledge when left to work on your own. Somewhere along
this point you convince yourself you never really understood it in the first place and that maybe
you should consider another career. You quickly realize how ridiculous that is
and decide to take a walk. After the walk you come back and realize the answer
was a missing semi-colon all along. After that point it almost seems silly that
the concept was not clicking in your head. Once your confidence is up to a level
you never thought you'd see again, the whole process starts all over again.

It's an emotional rollercoaster.

It's the same story time and time again, and if The Iron Yard has taught me
anything, it's that if you find yourself repeating yourself, make a robot to do
it for you. After googling "Learn Faster Javascript Robots" and coming up short,
I tried to think of another way to speed up the knowledge degradation to renewal
process. I examined the evidence: The concepts I seemed to have the strongest
retention on, are topics I helped my classmates understand. The answer was right
in front of me all along. It was so simple, like a missing semi-colon you just
can't spot until you do. If you learn something, teach someone else. Not only
does this help spread knowledge, but it also helps you retain that information
yourself.

This is not a new concept by any means. [Learn by Teaching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching)
has been around since Roman times. "Docendo discimus", or "by teaching, we learn"
was a concept first written about by Seneca the Younger in his letters to Lucilius.
The phrase is currently the motto of [many institutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus).

The Iron Yard has exposed me to working with various levels of experience and
learning styles and while I work to help my fellow classmates understand the
concepts we are learning in class, it is also helping me reinforce the concepts
to myself while teaching me about differing learning styles. If I am helping one classmate
vs. another, I may approach the problem from a different angle. It has reinforced
several things for me and I have the intense nature of this course to thank for
that.
