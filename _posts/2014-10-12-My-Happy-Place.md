###### My Happy Place

While sitting and discussing one of the many geeky topics that come up at The Iron
Yard, a classmate and I talked our favorite board and card games. We were sparked
with an idea to host an Iron Yard game night during the traditional week ending
Iron Pints.

We eagerly put together some information for our fellow classmates and encouraged
everyone to bring friends and family. We pooled together our games and posted a
sign up sheet... and waited.

Not much response at first and it looked like it would be a low-key evening with
a handful of people, which would have still been a good time. We sent out one
more reminder message and mentioned it in passing at lunch.

And then it blew up. The Iron Yard Campus Director and [Fyre](https://twitter.com/getfyre) offered to help
cater the event and bought beer and subs it was hosted at Canvs. With roughly 25-30 people all coming
together, making new friends, and playing new games, our little event turned
into a real moment that makes me appreciate and be proud to be a part of
the Orlando Tech community.

Unfortunately I didn't win any of the games I played (Losing out by ONE POINT in
  [DC Deck Building Game](https://www.cryptozoic.com/games/dc-comics-deck-building-game))
  but it was still a great time playing games after a long and tough week.
