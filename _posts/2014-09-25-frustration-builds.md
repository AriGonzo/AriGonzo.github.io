######Frustration builds


I try to make a point to recognize my flaws and shortcomings. One of them that I am actively working on is dealing with the out of nowhere bump in the road that temporarily throws me off my game. I had a bout with this on Wednesday night. After working for hours on my blog the night before, we were given some new instructions. As last night wasn’t done as I, being a future developer, should have done it, David was now walking us through the proper way to theme the site and have it build out correctly. The problem was that my blog didn’t look like most everyone else’s because I had copy pasta’d the theme. We were given our assignment and I could not figure out how to follow the instruction without tearing apart the blog I had spent hours on the night before. I tried for hours to work around it and make it mirror what David was looking for but while keeping my own things. At a certain point I realized that resistance was futile and knew I had to destroy it all. Burn it all to the ground. Or stop being dramatic and just rename the repository and start over, which I did.

As I went through the instructions, I began to get frustrated that I was not able to make the other one work. The plain black and white blog was just so lame compared to my last one, but there was nothing I could do about it. I attempted to finish the assignment and when I placed my links and built out the site and pushed it to git I felt the relief of being done. I checked out the blog live and clicked on the link…```404```. Wait, what? _Click_…```404```

I asked my classmates on hipchat what was going on and if anyone could help me. Logan answered and said he was able to find my blog post on a link that wasn’t the one on my ```index.html``` page. I wasn’t exactly sure how that blog post was on that url because I didn’t have the folder in my github repo. It was very confusing and frustrating but it accomplished the assignment. I figured I would ask David the following day.


I came into class feeling frustrated but decided to table that feeling for a while to focus on the new topic. During a break I asked David for clarification on the linking and it turns out how the link Logan gave me was correct. I was under the impression that *somehow* github would turn my link into another link. After finding that out, I felt great. We were given the new assignment and it was exactly what I had done the night before. Start over from scratch and rebuild your blog. I sat on the couch in the classroom and began to reset everything just as I had done the previous night. It felt like a good end assignment to a pretty great week.
