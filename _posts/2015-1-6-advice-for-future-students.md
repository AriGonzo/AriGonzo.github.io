##### as if written for Buzzfeed

Changing your life is not easy. No one ever said it was going to be easy and often times people don't realize that programming is a craft. As with any craft it takes time to hone you skills... but time is not a luxury that Iron Yard students have. 

I am currently a TA for The Iron Yard in Orlando's Ruby on Rails course. I was also a student in the previous Front-End Engineering cohort. Having this new perspective and hearing a lot of the same comments in stand-up as with our cohort, I wanted to share some of my learnings...but as I mentioned previously, time is not on our side. With this in mind, I've crafted this post to convey as much of my learnings as an Iron Yard survivor to current and future students while taking as little of their time as possible. Thanks Buzzfeed for the inspiration and format (but let's be honest, we should stop calling your posts 'articles').

### 1. Everything You Did Before Here Was Likely Wrong

Don't get down on yourself about this. We've all been there. We did a bit of hacking here and there. You made a website for your cat, "Rufus", and your parents thought it was just the best dang website on the intertubes. It wasn't. Learn the right ways to do things.

### 2. Get Some Sleep

Staying up until 4am just to finish that assignment is not how it's done. You need sleep to survive and learn. Give yourself a cut-off point and stick to it. Your brain and body will thank you when the alarm goes off in the morning.

### 3. You Aren't Supposed to Know This Stuff

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt3.gif" />

That's why you're paying The Iron Yard to teach it to you. Personally, I had a hard time with this one. Acceptance of your ignorance is a beautiful thing. It's okay not to know this stuff. It's not okay to continue not to know it after 12 weeks. Keep in mind that You do not know WHAT you do not know.

### 4. Github is Hard... For All of Us (aka You're Not Alone)

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt4.gif" />

There's a lot of commands and the command line can be really intimidating. The good news is that Github is a time machine and (almost) anything you do can be undone! Get in there and get your hands dirty! It becomes second nature after a while.

### 5. You're Going to Learn a LOT over the Next 12 Weeks

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt5.jpg" />

More than you thought you could learn in such a short amount of time. You'll hear this a lot but its like trying to take a sip from a fire hydrant.

### 6. Everthing Makes Perfect Sense During Lecture...

### 7. ...but the Knowledge Seems to Disappear When You're Working on you Assignment at Home

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt7.gif" />

It happens to all of us. Talk to your teammates and share knowledge. Between all of you, you picked up most of the information (probably).

### 8. There's Going to be Times You Feel Completely Lost

### 9. There's Going to be Times When Everything Clicks and You Feel Like a Computer GOD

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt9.gif" />

Learn to go with the ebb and flow. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind.

### 10. Pair Programming is Much More Valuable Than it May Seem Right Now

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt10.gif" />

I was dragged kicking and screaming into this camp, but I truly believe now that you can get much more done when there are two brains working together, talking, and solving problems than beating your head against the wall on your own.

### 11. You're Going to Miss Small Details That Will Turn Into Big Problems... Then You'll be Angry When You Figure Out Your Mistake

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt11.gif" />

Welcome to the rest of your professional life

### 12. You're Going to Meet Some Awesome People

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt12.gif" />

You'll be surrounded by like-minded people from different backgrounds. You all have the same common goal. Work together and learn from each other. You're all in this together

### 13. You're Going to Get Frustrated and Feel Like You're the Only One Who Doesn't Get It

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt13.gif" />

Share your frustrations and roadblocks with your teammates. Talk during standup. You'll be surprised at how many people are exactly where you are, but didn't have the nerve to speak up. If you're all there, you can work together to get better.

### 14. It's Important to Pull Your ~~Classmates~~ TEAMMATES Up When They Get Knocked Down

<img class="gif" src="/images/pt14.gif" />

You'd want them to do the same for you! You're all in this together.

### 15. Soon You'll Start Building Stuff, and That Feels AWESOME!

### 16. In 12 Weeks You're Going to Show Off the Fruits of your Labor in Front of your Friends, Family, and Future Colleagues

### Bonus: Your TAs WILL accept bribes

It won't help you in the class at all, but they'll like you a lot more.
