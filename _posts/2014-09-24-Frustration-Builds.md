### Frustration builds - Day 3

When I went into class today I felt good. I felt damn good. I had a themed out blog, I had my mind firmly wrapped around the concepts we had been learning in class, and I got just the right amount of sleep, despite the first in what I assume will be many many coding dreams. 

We’ve been learning the concepts behind jekyll and starting to give some meat to our blogs. The night prior I had stayed up relatively late trying to fine tune the blog. After looking through a host of different HD wallpaper site, I decided on a classic. Calvin & Hobbes staring into the night’s sky. I felt it fit my mix of philosophical mixed with childlike…because let’s face it, I’m pretty much a 5’11” 9yr old at heart.

I felt good enough to help others where they might be stuck. I explained the grueling process of adding the files to make my theme all nice and pretty-like when a classmate found a shortcut with the same result. Awesome! Together we got a few more people up to speed and really felt like we were coming together as a team.

In the afternoon it all turned around. We began a new task of tearing apart the blogs to turn them into proper jekyll themes. This is where I started to pull my hair out. As I had spent quite some time trying to get my blog layout just perfect, I was a little protective of it. Which is why my anxiety began to rise slightly when I realized that I’d have to scrap all of my work and start over in order to follow the steps listed out in the homework. 

Knowing I had no other choice, I renamed my old blog repository to “Overachiever” because that’s the payment you get for trying to get ahead. I opened up the new blog (this blog) and began tappa-tappa-tapping away. After much frustration and headache upon building, rebuilding, yet AGAIN rebuilding the site through jekyll, here we are.

Although I realize this will all come easily to me someday, the thought of tossing aside the bit of work I was proud of put me slightly on edge. As the week goes on, I hope to be able to incorporate the design ideas I had in the last blog into this one.
