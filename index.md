## Who Am I?

There comes a time in every persons life where they can choose to stay on the easy path they've always been on, or break away and chase their dreams.

My time is now.

A lifelong technophile and a product of the generation that straddles Wikipedia and Dewey Decimal. Netflix and Blockbuster Video. With a strong love and respect for technology and the internet, I'm taking the plunge and immersing myself in all things coding. Follow along as I chronicle my journey from coding novice to Jr Web Developer in Orlando's first Iron Yard Academy Front End Engineering cohort.
