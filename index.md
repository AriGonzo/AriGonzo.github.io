## Who Am I?

A lifelong technophile and a product of the generation that straddles Wikipedia and Dewey Decimal. Netflix and Blockbuster Video. With a strong love and respect for technology and the internet, I'm taking the plunge and immersing myself in all things coding. Follow along as I chronicle my journey from coding novice to Jr Web Developer in Orlando's first Iron Yard Academy Front End Engineering cohort.
